# Map'O

The Map’O project provides map makers with limited knowledge of GIS technologies a ready-to-use web app with intuitive onboarding, schema creation and editing, both manual and automated data ingest as well as customizable map styling. The focus lies on curated import and re-use of existing data from linked open data sources. The modular design will allow basic projects to be further expanded by more experienced developers, and will also yield reusable components with a strong design language to use in their own projects.
